Spring Boot Maven Plugin

  The Spring Boot Maven Plugin provides Spring Boot support in Maven, allowing you to package executable
  jar or war archives and run an application “in-place”.

* Goals Overview

  The Spring Boot Plugin has the following goals.

  * {{{./run-mojo.html}spring-boot:run}} runs your Spring Boot application.

  * {{{./repackage-mojo.html}spring-boot:repackage}} repackages your jar/war to be executable.

  * {{{./start-mojo.html}spring-boot:start}} and {{{./stop-mojo.html}spring-boot:stop}} to manage
    the lifecycle of your Spring Boot application (i.e. for integration tests).

  * {{{./build-info-mojo.html}spring-boot:build-info}} generates build information that can be used
    by the Actuator.



* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Spring Boot Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some
  more specific use cases are described in the examples given below.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the existing
  {{{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-boot}stack overflow issue}}. If you still don't get an
  answer, feel free to create a new thread with the <<<#spring-boot>>> tag.

  in our {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}.
