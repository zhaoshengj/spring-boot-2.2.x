Various properties can be specified inside your `application.properties` file, inside your `application.yml` file, or as command line switches.
This appendix provides a list of common Spring Boot properties and references to the underlying classes that consume them.

TIP: Spring Boot provides various conversion mechanism with advanced value formatting, make sure to review <<spring-boot-features.adoc#boot-features-external-config-conversion, the properties conversion section>>.

NOTE: Property contributions can come from additional jar files on your classpath, so you should not consider this an exhaustive list.
