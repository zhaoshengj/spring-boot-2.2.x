= Heap Dump (`heapdump`)

The `heapdump` endpoint provides a heap dump from the application's JVM.

== Retrieving the Heap Dump

To retrieve the heap dump, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/heapdump`.
The response is binary data in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/samples/hprof.html[HPROF] format and can be large.
Typically, you should save the response to disk for subsequent analysis.
When using curl, this can be achieved by using the `-O` option, as shown in the following example:

include::{snippets}heapdump/curl-request.adoc[]

The preceding example results in a file named `heapdump` being written to the current working directory.
